## Requirements
This mod requires at least version 1.9 (not yet released) of [Cyber Engine Tweaks mod](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks/releases).  
  
  

## **How to Install**

  
Extract the ZIP file to `Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods  
`  
  

## **How to Use**

The mod window will appear by default when opening the CET console. If you'd like to toggle it's visibility, you can use the F2 key.  
  
Actions like opening doors, affecting cars, etc. are dependent on you looking at the object you'd like to affect in the game. For now, the CET console must be open to be able to interact with the mod UI.
